class Cpmd_NVE(rfm.RunOnlyRegressionTest, pin_prefix=True):
    '''Base class for the CPMD NVE Test.

    The CPMD code is a plane wave/pseudopotential implementation
    of Density Functional Theory, particularly designed
    for ab-initio molecular dynamics. Its first version was
    developed by JÃ¼rg Hutter at IBM Zurich Research
    Laboratory starting from the original Car-Parrinello
    codes.

    The presented abstract run-only class checks the perfomance of CPMD.
    To do this, it is necessary to define in tests the name
    of executable file (executable), the running script
    (input file), the output file, as well as set the reference
    values of energy and possible deviations from this value.
    This data is used to check if the task is being executed
    correctly, that is, the final energy is correct
    (approximately the reference). The default assumption is that
    CPMD is already installed on the device under test.
